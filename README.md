The EventCalendar app is a simple calendar application that enables users to save events for each hour of the day. This browser-based app leverages dynamic updates to HTML and CSS, powered by jQuery. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing and organizing daily events.

Key Features:
1. Interactive Hourly Layout: The app presents an hourly layout, displaying the hours of the day vertically as rows. Each row contains a time slot, event input field, and a save button. Users can easily navigate through the hours to input and save events.
2. Event Input and Save: Users can enter event details in the corresponding input field for each hour. After entering the event, they can click the save button to store the event for that specific hour. The app ensures that events are saved persistently, so users can revisit the page and view their previously saved events.
3. Current Time Highlight: The app dynamically highlights the current hour to provide a visual cue for users, making it easy to identify the current time slot. This feature helps users stay organized and aware of the ongoing hour while planning their day.
4. Dynamic Date and Time Handling: The EventCalendar app uses a date and time handling solution, such as the Day.js library, to work with dates, times, and their formatting. This ensures accurate and consistent representation of the current date and time, as well as other date-related functionality within the app.
5. Responsive Design: The app is built with a responsive design approach, allowing it to adapt to various screen sizes and devices. Whether accessed on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device, the EventCalendar app offers an optimized user experience without sacrificing functionality.
6. User-Friendly Interface: The app provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. Users can effortlessly input and save events, navigate through different hours, and view their schedule at a glance. The clean and visually appealing design enhances the overall user experience.

Technologies Used:
1. HTML: Provides the structure and layout of the calendar app.
2. CSS: Defines the styles and visual presentation of the app.
3. JavaScript (jQuery): Enables dynamic updates to the HTML and CSS, handling user interactions, event storage, and time management.
